# ðŸŽ§ Clean Music â€“ Remove Website Watermarks from Music Files

In **Iran**, many music download websites automatically insert their **website address** into MP3 files as:

- `ID3 tags` (like album, comment, or artist fields)
- File names (like `Artist - SongName - www.sitemusic.ir.mp3`)

This clutter is **annoying**, makes organizing your music hard, and ruins the music library experience on your phone, player, or media app.

This project provides a **Python-based utility** to:

âœ… Clean up ID3 tags (`album`, `artist`, `title`, `comment`)  
âœ… Remove all **site URLs**, special characters, numbers from file names  
âœ… Keep useful metadata (like `feat.` or `&`)  
âœ… Normalize names with clean, human-readable formatting
